## Thoughts about Wasp
### Impressions
- Simple installation
- The docs are clean and kinda easy to read and follow
- B+ Features out of the box[Auth, Database] 

### What I don't like
- Gives me the same vibes as basic React
- No File Based Router is a bummer for me
- This defining of routes at the entry file `main.wasp` isnt for me.

### What I would like to see:
- File based router
- Bring Your Own*** Everything[ Here is a crazy thought, instead of the framework dictating you to use Prisma, let the developer choose their own database provider/orm, same for auth. Of course I think this is where they will head to eventually.]


Overall I am impressed with the beta release. Keeping my ðŸ‘€ on it. # wasp-first-look
